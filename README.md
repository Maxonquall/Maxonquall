Hi 👋 My name is Maxim Sirotkin
===============================

Java Developer
--------------

🎓 I'm engineer with a Master's degree in Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for optimizing processes and systems, which eventually led me to delve deeper into programming languages like Java. 💻 Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Java, exploring its versatility in building robust backend systems, web applications, and Android apps. I'm particularly intrigued by its object-oriented paradigm and the vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available for development. 🚀 Beyond Java, I'm also keen on expanding my knowledge across various technologies and paradigms, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's diving into new programming languages, exploring emerging trends in software engineering, or contributing to open-source projects, I'm always eager to broaden my horizons.
